# **Email Campaign Characterization and Tracking using Machine Learning**

## **Project Overview**

In this project, we develop a machine learning model to characterize email campaigns and predict whether an email will be ignored, read, or acknowledged by the recipient. The dataset used consists of email records from various small to medium business owners engaged in Gmail-based email marketing strategies.

The primary objective is to build a classification model that accurately predicts user engagement with an email based on its features.

## **Project Motivation**

With the rise of digital marketing, email campaigns have become a crucial tool for businesses to communicate with prospective customers. However, the effectiveness of these campaigns largely depends on how recipients engage with the emails. This project aims to:
- Characterize emails based on their content and features.
- Track user actions (ignored, read, acknowledged).
- Build a machine learning classification model to predict email engagement based on provided features.

---

## **Dataset Information**

The dataset contains **48,291 rows** and **12 columns**. Each row represents a unique email record with various features, such as:
- **Email ID**
- **Time Sent**
- **Content Type**
- **Recipient Characteristics**

### **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
- Handled missing values using visualizations and data dropping methods.
- Verified for duplicate entries and ensured data integrity.
  

---

## **Modeling Approach**

1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Checked for missing values and dropped rows with null entries.
   - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to understand the relationships and characteristics of features.
   
2. **Model Training**: 
   - Multiple machine learning algorithms were explored, including:
     - Logistic Regression
     - Random Forest Classifier
     - XGBoost Classifier
   
3. **Imbalanced Data Handling**: 
   - Used **SMOTE** to handle any class imbalance in the dataset.

4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - GridSearchCV was used for tuning hyperparameters to optimize model performance.

## **Evaluation Metrics**

The performance of the models was evaluated using the following metrics:
- **Accuracy Score**
- **Confusion Matrix**
- **ROC Curve**
- **F1-Score**

These metrics were used to measure the effectiveness of the model in predicting email engagement.

## **Results**

The best performing model was the **Random Forest Classifier** with an accuracy of **78%** and an F1-Score of **Y%**. Detailed evaluation results, including the confusion matrix and ROC curves, can be found in the notebook.

---

## **Conclusion**

This project demonstrates the ability to predict the engagement of email recipients using machine learning models. The model can help businesses better understand their email marketing strategies, optimize content, and improve the overall conversion rate of their campaigns.

Future improvements can include:
- Adding more features like user demographics or historical data.
- Trying advanced models like neural networks.
